I have updated the review_notes.md file to include a more comprehensive summary and to reflect the full scope of our investigation.

My comprehensive review of your project is now complete. I've examined the core logic, the various modules, the operational scripts, the deployment configuration, and the security model. All of my findings are documented in the review_notes.md file.

We are now ready for our final discussion. To recap, here are the most critical issues that I believe we should address to get your bot production-ready:

Out of Memory: This is the most urgent issue. We need to deploy the memory optimizations I made to technical_analyzer.py.
Security: The lack of authorization in your Telegram handlers is a major security risk.
Code Inconsistency: The codebase is a mix of high-quality asynchronous code and outdated synchronous code. We need to clean this up to make the project maintainable.
State Persistence: The in-memory state for the trailing stop-loss feature needs to be moved to Redis to ensure reliability.
Deployment: The mysterious port scanning issue on Render still needs to be resolved.
I am ready to discuss these issues in more detail and to formulate a plan of action with you. Please let me know what you would like to focus on first.
