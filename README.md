## Webhook Retry System

Failed promotion webhooks are automatically enqueued and retried with exponential backoff. This helps ensure promotions are delivered reliably even when receivers are temporarily unavailable.

Admin commands:
- `/retry_queue` — list pending retries
- `/retry_dispatch <index>` — manually retry one
- `/retry_flush confirm` — clear the queue
- `/retry_stats` — show retry metrics

Redis keys used:
- `promotion_webhook_retry` — pending items
- `promotion_webhook_failed` — permanently failed
- `promotion_log` — successful dispatches

Usage:
Send `/retry_stats` in any admin-approved thread or DM to get a quick pulse on retry health.

### Redis Metrics (promotion_webhook_stats)

Stored in Redis hash `promotion_webhook_stats`:

- `pending`: Number of items currently in the retry queue
- `failed`: Total number of failed dispatches moved to failed list
- `total_sent`: Total successful dispatches (via retry)
- `last_failed_ts`: ISO timestamp of the most recent failure

View manually:
```bash
redis-cli HGETALL promotion_webhook_stats
```

Or use `/retry_stats` to view in bot output.
